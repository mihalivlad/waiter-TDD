## Purpose
This repository contains some test methods in RestaurantTest class. You need to write the code in order to pass the tests. As simple as that, right?

## Rules
* Clone the repo
* Create a branch with your name
* Push a commit after each passing test
* You are not allowed to change anything in class RestaurantTest

In the end, it should look like a zen garden with no hardcoded stuff, no duplicate code and no huge classes or methods. 
Enjoy!
